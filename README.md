# Year Picker Field for Gravity Forms

This is a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) plugin that extends the [Gravity Forms plugin](https://www.gravityforms.com/) to provide a custom Year Picker field type to Gravity Forms. Useful when you just want the user to select a year value from a range of values instead of selecting a date value.

Provides features to automatically generate the years available based on a defined maximum and minimum value.
